## Prerequisites

1. **Access to Hardware:**
   - 4x NVIDIA L40S GPUs
   - 8x NVIDIA A100 40GB GPUs

2. **Software Environment:**
   - **Operating System:** Linux (Ubuntu recommended)
   - **CUDA Toolkit:** Compatible versions for both GPU types
   - **NVIDIA Drivers:** Latest drivers supporting L40S and A100 GPUs
   - **Deep Learning Frameworks:** PyTorch or TensorFlow (depending on the model)

3. **Clone the ChAI Lab Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/chaidiscovery/chai-lab.git
   ```

---

## Step 1: Set Up the Environment

### 1.1 Install Dependencies

Navigate to the repository directory and install the required Python packages.

```bash
cd chai-lab
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 1.2 Configure CUDA and cuDNN

Ensure that the CUDA Toolkit and cuDNN versions are compatible with your GPUs and deep learning framework.

Set environment variables if necessary:

```bash
export CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$CUDA_HOME/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```

---

## Step 2: Data Preparation

- Ensure that all datasets required by the model are prepared and stored on fast-access storage (preferably SSDs or NVMe drives).
- Preprocess data if necessary:

  ```bash
  python data_preprocessing.py
  ```

---

## Step 3: Optimize the Model for Multi-GPU Training

### 3.1 Use Data Parallelism

#### PyTorch Example:

```python
import torch
from torch.nn.parallel import DataParallel

model = MyModel()
model = DataParallel(model)
```

#### TensorFlow Example:

```python
strategy = tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy()
with strategy.scope():
    model = MyModel()
```

### 3.2 Utilize Distributed Data Parallel (DDP)

#### PyTorch DDP (Recommended over `DataParallel`):

```python
import torch
from torch.nn.parallel import DistributedDataParallel as DDP

# Initialize process group
torch.distributed.init_process_group(backend='nccl')

# Set device
device = torch.device('cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu')

# Wrap the model
model = MyModel().to(device)
model = DDP(model, device_ids=[device])
```

Launch the training script with `torch.distributed.launch`:

```bash
python -m torch.distributed.launch --nproc_per_node=4 train.py
```

### 3.3 Optimize Batch Size

- Increase the batch size to utilize GPU memory effectively.
- Ensure that the batch size is divisible by the number of GPUs for optimal distribution.

---

## Step 4: Mixed Precision Training

Utilize mixed precision to reduce memory usage and increase computational speed.

### 4.1 Enable Automatic Mixed Precision (AMP)

#### PyTorch Example:

```python
from torch.cuda.amp import autocast, GradScaler

scaler = GradScaler()
for data, target in dataloader:
    data, target = data.to(device), target.to(device)
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    with autocast():
        output = model(data)
        loss = loss_fn(output, target)
    scaler.scale(loss).backward()
    scaler.step(optimizer)
    scaler.update()
```

#### TensorFlow Example:

```python
from tensorflow.keras.mixed_precision import experimental as mixed_precision

policy = mixed_precision.Policy('mixed_float16')
mixed_precision.set_policy(policy)

# Define optimizer
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()
optimizer = mixed_precision.LossScaleOptimizer(optimizer)
```

---

## Step 5: Profiling and Benchmarking

Use profiling tools to identify bottlenecks.

### 5.1 NVIDIA Nsight Systems

Install Nsight Systems:

```bash
sudo apt install nvidia-nsight-systems
```

Run the profiler:

```bash
nsys profile python train.py
```

### 5.2 TensorBoard Profiling

Add profiling hooks in your code to visualize performance in TensorBoard.

---

## Step 6: Optimize Data Loading

Ensure that the data loading pipeline is efficient to prevent it from becoming a bottleneck.

### 6.1 Use Efficient DataLoaders

#### PyTorch:

```python
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader

dataloader = DataLoader(
    dataset,
    batch_size=batch_size,
    num_workers=4,
    pin_memory=True,
    shuffle=True
)
```

#### TensorFlow:

```python
dataset = dataset.prefetch(buffer_size=tf.data.AUTOTUNE)
```

### 6.2 Data Caching

Cache datasets in memory if they fit, or use disk-based caching mechanisms.

---

## Step 7: Model-Specific Optimizations

- **Layer Fusion:** Combine adjacent layers to reduce memory access overhead.
- **Custom CUDA Kernels:** Write custom operations if standard libraries are inefficient.
- **Gradient Accumulation:** If memory is limited, accumulate gradients over several mini-batches.

---

## Step 8: Training on Different Hardware Configurations

### 8.1 Training on 4x L40S GPUs

- Adjust configurations specific to L40S GPUs.
- Ensure that all GPUs are recognized:

  ```bash
  nvidia-smi
  ```

- Start training with optimized settings:

  ```bash
  python -m torch.distributed.launch --nproc_per_node=4 train.py --config configs/l40s_config.yaml
  ```

### 8.2 Training on 8x A100 40GB GPUs

- Adjust configurations specific to A100 GPUs.
- Verify GPU availability:

  ```bash
  nvidia-smi
  ```

- Start training:

  ```bash
  python -m torch.distributed.launch --nproc_per_node=8 train.py --config configs/a100_config.yaml
  ```

---

## Step 9: Monitoring and Logging

- **Use TensorBoard or Weights & Biases** for real-time monitoring.
- **Log GPU utilization and memory usage** to identify bottlenecks.

---

## Step 10: Evaluate and Compare Results

### 10.1 Performance Metrics

- **Training Time per Epoch**
- **Throughput (samples per second)**
- **GPU Utilization**

### 10.2 Model Metrics

- **Validation Accuracy**
- **Loss Curves**

### 10.3 Analyze Scalability

- Compare how well the model scales with the number of GPUs on each hardware configuration.

---

## Additional Tips

- **Update Software Stack:** Ensure you have the latest versions of PyTorch or TensorFlow that support the new hardware features of L40S and A100 GPUs.
- **Use NVIDIA Apex (PyTorch):** For further optimizations like fused optimizers.

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/apex
  cd apex
  pip install -v --no-cache-dir ./
  ```

- **Set Appropriate Environment Variables:**

  ```bash
  export CUDA_LAUNCH_BLOCKING=1     # For debugging
  export NCCL_DEBUG=INFO            # To debug multi-GPU communication issues
  ```

- **Consult Official Documentation:**

  - [NVIDIA Developer Documentation](https://developer.nvidia.com/documentation)
  - [PyTorch Distributed Training](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/dist_overview.html)
  - [TensorFlow Distributed Training](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/distributed_training)
